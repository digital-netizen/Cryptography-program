# Cryptography-program
This project is a basic cryptography program that encrypts the plaintext or the sender's original message. Then, the receiver decrypts the encrypted message. 
The primary purpose of this program is to demonstrate how cryptography applications work in-depth and how they can be developed better depending on the use of keys; hence, it is crucial to have robust cryptography applications.
